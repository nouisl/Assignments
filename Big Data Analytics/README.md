This module aims to introduce the student to middleware often used in Big Data analytics and implementing algorithms using such middleware.<br />

> **Learning Outcomes**:
> <br />- Understanding of Algorithmic approaches for handling batch and streaming analysis
> <br />- Understanding of middleware that can be used to enable algorithms to scale up to analysis of large datasets.
> <br />- Understanding of the impact of the middleware on how algorithms are articulated.
> <br />- Numeracy/computational skills thus reason with numbers/mathematical concepts.
