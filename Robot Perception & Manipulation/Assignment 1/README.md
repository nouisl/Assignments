### Running Mask-RCNN from a Webcam 

Goal of the assignment was to write a program to read the images from a webcam stream, then feed these images to the Mask-RCNN network and visualize the results in real-time. The outputs of Mask-RCNN will be both the object (bounding box + object class) and the
object segmented mask. Besides that the center point and the two principal axes of each segmented mask are visualized.
Additionally, a report had to be written about the Mask-RCNN paper.
