This module aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of the various methods in robotperception and manipulation and hands on experience using tools as well as coding of own algorithms.
 
> **Learning Outcomes and Skills**:
> <br />Demonstrate a systematic understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of robot perception and manipulation.
> <br />Describe state-of-the-art techniques in robotics, particularly on visual and touch perception, perception algorithms and control methods for robot manipulation.
> <br />Debate the benefits and drawbacks of the various methods in robot perception and manipulation.
> <br />Apply the taught methods in real-world applications (e.g., warehouse robotics problems).
> <br />Illustrate hands-on experience using tools as well as coding of own algorithms for robot perception and manipulation.
