This module aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the benefits and drawbacks of the various methods in robotperception and manipulation and hands on experience using tools as well as coding of own algorithms.
 
> **Learning Outcomes and Skills**:
> <br />- Demonstrate a systematic understanding of the theoretical and practical aspects of robot perception and manipulation.
> <br />- Describe state-of-the-art techniques in robotics, particularly on visual and touch perception, perception algorithms and control methods for robot manipulation.
> <br />- Debate the benefits and drawbacks of the various methods in robot perception and manipulation.
> <br />- Apply the taught methods in real-world applications (e.g., warehouse robotics problems).
> <br />- Illustrate hands-on experience using tools as well as coding of own algorithms for robot perception and manipulation.
> <br />-  Self-management readiness to accept responsibility (i.e. leadership), flexibility, resilience, self-starting, appropriate assertiveness, time management, readiness to improve own performance based on feedback/reflective learning.
> <br />-  Problem solving analysing facts and situations and applying creative thinking to develop appropriate solutions.
