### Implementing an RL algorithm to solve the PandaPickAndPlace-v3 problem

Goal of the assignment was to choose an RL algorithm that is thought to be well-suitable to solve the
PandaPickAndPlace-v3 problem, reimplementating that RL algorithm whilst being able to re-use any existing source
code available, given the environment is PandaPickAndPlace-v3. Also the algorithm should be trained and the results visualized.
Additionally, a report had to be written about the chosen RL algorithm.
