This module aims to introduce the student to the concept of an autonomous agent, the key approaches developed for decision-making in autonomous systems, the key issues with uncertainty of sensors and actuators/motors on modern robot platforms and the key issues surrounding the development of autonomous robots, whilst using a contemporary platform for experimental robotics.

> **Learning Outcomes and Skills**:
> <br />- Ability to explain the notion of an agent, how agents are distinct from other software paradigms (e.g., objects), and judge the characteristics of applications that lend themselves to an agent-oriented solution.
> <br />- Identify the key issues associated with constructing agents capable of intelligent autonomous action.	
> <br />- Describe the main approaches taken to developing such agents.
> <br />- Describe how Bayesian belief revision can overcome the uncertainty that is inherent with sensors and actuators, due to real-world non-determinism.
> <br />- Identify key issues involved in building agents that must sense and act within the physical world.
> <br />- Program and deploy autonomous robots for specific tasks. 	
> <br />- Problem Solving - Numeracy and computational skills 	
> <br />- Problem solving â€“ Analysing facts and situations and applying creative thinking to develop appropriate solutions.
