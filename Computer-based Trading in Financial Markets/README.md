This module aims to develop an understanding of financial markets at the level of individual trades, to provide an overview of the range of different computer-based trading applications and techniques. It also aims to introduce the key issues with using historical high-frequency financial data for developing computer-based trading strategies, to provide an overview of statistical and computational methods for the design of trading strategies and their risk management, whilst developing a practical understanding of the design, implementation, evaluation, and deployment of trading strategies.

**Learning Outcomes and Skills**:
<br />- Have an understanding of market microstructure and its impact on trading.
<br />- Understand the spectrum of computer-based trading applications and techniques, from profit-seeking trading strategies to execution algorithms.
<br />- Be able to design trading strategies and evaluate critically their historical performance and robustness.
<br />- Understand the common pitfalls in developing trading strategies with historical data.
<br />- Understand the benchmarks used to evaluate execution algorithms.
<br />- Understand methods for measuring risk and diversification at the portfolio level.
<br />- Self-management (Readiness to accept responsibility (i.e. leadership), flexibility, resilience, self-starting, appropriate assertiveness, time management, readiness to improve own performance based on feedback/reflective learning.)
<br />- Application of numeracy (Manipulation of numbers, general mathematical awareness and its application in practical contexts (e.g. measuring, weighing, estimating and applying formulae).)
<br />- Problem solving (Analysing facts and situations and applying creative thinking to develop appropriate solutions.)
